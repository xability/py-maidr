"""Helpers for locating and referencing the bundled ``maidr.js`` assets.

This module centralises the logic for switching between CDN-hosted and
locally bundled copies of the MAIDR JavaScript and CSS.  A prebuilt copy
of ``maidr.js`` is shipped inside the wheel under ``maidr/static/`` so
that users with no internet connection can still render accessible
plots by passing ``use_cdn=False`` to the public API.
