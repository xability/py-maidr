    Whether the call that produced *plot* drew a histogram made of bars.

    `sns.histplot(x=..., y=...)` is a **2D** histogram: seaborn draws it as a
    ``QuadMesh`` of joint counts, not as bars. `hist` promises one bin per bar
    with a count, which such a layer has neither of -- so registering it
    promises a reading nothing can produce, and extraction then took the whole
    figure down with it. `sns.jointplot(kind="hist")` produced no HTML at all,
    and so did any supported chart that happened to share the axes (#388).

    Asked of the axes rather than of the arguments, because "did this draw
    bars" is the question the extractor actually needs answered, and a `y=`
    keyword is seaborn's spelling of it rather than the thing itself.

    Parameters
    ----------
    plot : Any
        Whatever the patched call returned.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        True when the axes holds at least one ``BarContainer``.
