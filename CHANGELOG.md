This pull request updates the `exclude_commit_patterns` in the `pyproject.toml` file. The previous
  commits that don't match the conventional commits prefixes and internal changes that do not
  necessarily affect end-user interactions, such as `chore`, `ci`, and `style`, are excluded from
  our CHANGELOG and GitHub release note moving forward. This is not a direct fix, but after this
  change, it ensures that only relevant commits are included in the release changelog as a fair
  stopgap solution.

### Features

- Fetch LLM API keys from user env variables ([#102](https://github.com/xability/py-maidr/pull/102),
  [`fc84593`](https://github.com/xability/py-maidr/commit/fc84593a9b01904d24fd86da88f79e25db02417a))

<!-- Suggested PR Title: [feat/fix/refactor/perf/test/ci/docs/chore] brief description of the change
  --> <!-- Please follow Conventional Commits: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/ -->

## Description This pull request fixes the handling of API keys for LLMs in the code. It adds a
  JavaScript script to handle the API keys for LLMs and initializes the LLM secrets in the MAIDR
  instance. The script injects the LLM API keys into the MAIDR instance and sets the appropriate
  settings based on the presence of the Gemini and OpenAI API keys. This ensures that the LLM
  functionality works correctly with the updated API key handling.

# Pull Request

## Description This PR addresses an issue where `commit-lint` job crashes when validating pull
  requests.

## Changes Made Currently, the commitlint config file is getting loaded as an ES module whilst it
  contains vanilla javascript configurations. This causes the job to crash because it expects a
  common javascript config but finds an ES module config. To address this issue The commit-lint
  config file has been changed to a `common-js` file instead of a `js` file and the conventional
  commit dependancy will now be installed during the job via npm.

## Screenshots (if applicable) After making the changes, I tested the commit-lint job locally and
  here is an excerpt of the execution: ``` (py-maidr) ➜ py_maidr git:(Krishna/fix-commitlint) act -j

Added bug report and feature request templates to improve the issue creation process. These
  templates provide a standardized structure for reporting bugs and requesting new features, making
  it easier for contributors to provide clear and concise information. This will help streamline the
  issue triage and resolution process.

The bug report template includes sections for describing the bug, steps to reproduce, actual and
  expected behavior, screenshots, and additional information. The feature request template includes
  sections for describing the requested feature, motivation, proposed solution, and additional
  context.

This commit follows the established commit message convention of starting with a verb in the
  imperative form, followed by a brief description of the change. It also includes a type prefix
  ("feat") to indicate that it is a new feature.

### Continuous Integration

- Add workflow for publishing docs ([#44](https://github.com/xability/py-maidr/pull/44),
  [`a6c5886`](https://github.com/xability/py-maidr/commit/a6c5886cc66339eabdfac3c8dc8bb10ee2c037c6))

`docs.yml` automates the publishing of py-maidr documentation to GitHub Pages. This builds the
  static sources using `quarto` for the website and `quartodoc` for the API Reference. The rendering
  and publishing are accomplished using Quarto's github actions, which can be found at
  https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-actions.

Resolves: #43

### Features

Combined the black, commit-message-lint, and the unit test workflow into one called ci.yml. This is
  beneficial because it could be reused in the release pipeline.

Resolves: #39

- Setup release pipeline ([#42](https://github.com/xability/py-maidr/pull/42),
  [`634f91c`](https://github.com/xability/py-maidr/commit/634f91cdf5a806f2b451727ccc94b970c7af6a90))

`release.yml` configures the github workflow to lint the commit message, format of the code, and the
  unit tests. After successfully completing those jobs, the pipeline builds the package, updates the
  semantic version according to the commit message and publishes to the GitHub Release as well as to
  the PyPi.

Resolves: #41

### Documentation

- Add docstring ([#34](https://github.com/xability/py-maidr/pull/34),

- Add quarto and quartodoc for static website ([#38](https://github.com/xability/py-maidr/pull/38),
  [`011b1b2`](https://github.com/xability/py-maidr/commit/011b1b2b916df3036644d43cd6741f663ca64bc3))

`_quarto.yml` includes the base structure of the static website with a navbar and the main site. The
  navbar includes 'Overview', 'Get Started', and 'API Referece' sections, which are structured in
  `_index.qmd`, `_get_started.qmd`, and the quartodoc section of `_quarto.yml` respectively.
  Currently, the 'Overview' and 'Get Started' sections are left empty, which will be generated in
  the upcoming releases. The 'API Reference' section will include the docstring in a neat format
  generated by `quartodoc`.
